- changed plugin(s) typo in docker-compose
- added plugin.ini to static files so docker-composer reference works
- changed path for plugin.ini and pathfinder.ini from /app to /conf
- added another traefik label, so traefik always forwards to correct network
- added version string to composer install, otherwise build fails with newest composer version
